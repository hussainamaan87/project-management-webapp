## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hussainamaan87/project-management-webapp.git
   cd project-management-webapp
2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Set up environment variables by creating a .env file in the root directory, with the following values:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=<Your AWS RDS PostgreSQL URL>
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Your AWS Access Key>
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Your AWS Secret Key>
Update these values with your AWS credentials and database URL.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view and interact with the application.

## üöÄ Deployment
This application is designed to be deployed on AWS EC2 for the backend, with AWS Lambda. For static assets, use AWS S3. You can follow these steps for deployment:
1. Set up an EC2 instance and configure it with Node.js and Express.
2. Use AWS Lambda for serverless functions, connecting it to the backend APIs.
3. Host static files (like images or front-end assets) on AWS S3.
Make sure to configure AWS VPC for secure and efficient networking between the services.
